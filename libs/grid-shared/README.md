## Information


- [ReactDataGrid](https://reactdatagrid.com) is a React component for displaying tabular data, built from the ground up for 2023, by a team with [20+ years](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#a-trip-down-the-memory-lane) of experience building datagrids.
- It integrates deeply with [Material UI](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#material-ui-and-others), but thanks to its highly customizable rendering engine, it can be used with any UI framework, or without any UI framework at all. If you are already using Material UI, this datagrid will seamlessly integrate with your application in terms of user experience, theming, and customization.
- It is very [light weight](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#bundle-size)  without compromising on features, thanks to a combination of [thoughtful design](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#features),  [modern tooling & ecosystem](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#evolution-of-webpack-tree-shaking-and-es6-modules), [plugin architecture](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#pluggability-over-configuration), and [ES6 modules](https://reactdatagrid.com/docs/welcome#evolution-of-webpack-tree-shaking-and-es6-modules). More on this below.
- Built in React for React, with TypeScript.
